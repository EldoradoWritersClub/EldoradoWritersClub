It was sunny and warm, the kids were out playing, and a gentle breeze permeated the air. Silas and Cora, your average happy couple without a worry in their soul, were enjoying time with each other on an evening walk. Although, this particular day wasn&rsquo;t as average for the couple as you&rsquo;d expect. For months, Silas has been planning on making one of the most important decisions of his life on this day: proposing. Silas had organized a fireworks show that night, and, as they went off in the beautiful night sky, he planned on guiding her to the immense fountain in the middle of downtown. For now, they explored different shops and areas, giggling and laughing with joy as if there was nothing else in their lives but each other. Later on, they enjoyed an elegant dinner with each other. No distractions. Silas and Cora were all that mattered to each other at the moment. Silas was satisfied. Everything was building up so fluently. It was just as he had planned, and he was sure that the night would be nothing short of perfect. After dinner, to get to the show in time, Silas ushered Cora to begin walking towards the show. As they walked, arms linked, feeling romantic, they witnessed the glamorous sunset together, arriving shortly after dark. Together they sat and beheld the stunning fireworks. As each rocket flew into the air and exploded with glamorous colors and patterns, Silas and Cora couldn&rsquo;t help but sit in awe with every explosion. Before the show was over, Silas leaned over to his beloved, telling her of a wonderful spot that would make the show more magical. He led her to the fountain in the center of downtown and had Cora behold the view. Although there were people all around them, the moment still felt as special and meaningful as the rest of the night had. Silas interrupted their silence &ldquo;Actually, Cora, I have a question&hellip;&rdquo; He stopped and took a second to face away from her, giving him time to pull out the ring. Turning around, box in hand, Silas said &ldquo;Cora. will you- Cora?&rdquo; She wasn&rsquo;t there. Cora was nowhere to be seen. &ldquo;Cora? Where did you go? Cora!&rdquo; He looked everywhere. In a panic, he frantically ran around the area but had no luck. Crying, he sat himself on the side of the fountain. However, he noticed something on the ground in front of him, resembling a business card. Intrigued, he picked it up to read it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You have sinned against me.
